Quit playin' games with my heart 
Everybody, rock your body\nEverybody, rock your body right\nBackstreet's back, alright
Tell me why, I never wanna hear you say\n(Never wanna hear you say)\nI want it that way 
You can stand under my umbrella
Shine bright like a diamond
Hit me baby one more time
Oops, I did it again
Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play\nAnd the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate\nBaby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake\nI shake it off, I shake it off
Hey I just met you\nAnd this is crazy\nBut here's my number\nSo call me maybe
It's Friday, Friday\nGotta get down on Friday\nEverybody's lookin' forward to the weekend, weekend
For jeg vil meget heller' ud i det store blå,\nmed mine gode gamle røde gummistøvler på
Everybody sing this song, DooDah, DooDah\nWell everybody sing this song all the DooDah day\nEverybody sing this song, DooDah, DooDah
I'm a Barbie girl, in the Barbie world\nLife in plastic, it's fantastic\nYou can brush my hair, undress me everywhere\nImagination, life is your creation
Everything is Awesome\nEverything is cool when you're part of a team
Let it go, let it go\nCan't hold it back anymore
Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dundun dun\ndundundun dun dun dun dun dun dun dundun dundun\nDarude - Sandstorm
Computational Chemistry is fun fun fun
imayama simayamaiyama, kumayama bibdabadaba\n ITS THE CIRCLE OF LIFE
Why did the old man fall into the well?\nBecause he could not see that well
